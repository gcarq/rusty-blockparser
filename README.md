# rusty-blockparser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gcarq/rusty-blockparser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gcarq/rusty-blockparser) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/gcarq/rusty-blockparser/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/gcarq/rusty-blockparser?branch=master) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rusty-blockparser.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rusty-blockparser/)

rusty-blockparser is a Bitcoin Blockchain Parser written in **Rust language**.

It allows extraction of various data types (blocks, transactions, scripts, public keys/hashes, balances, ...) and UTXDO dumps from Bitcoin based blockchains.

**NOTE**: Use the branch `use-bitcoin-lib` for Bitcoin as it implements SegWit and BECH32 address support (https://github.com/gcarq/rusty-blockparser/pull/62). This will be merged eventually but at this point it would break support for other coins.

##### **Currently Supported Blockchains:**

 `Bitcoin`, `Namecoin`, `Litecoin`, `Dogecoin`, `Myriadcoin`, `Unobtanium`, `NoteBlockchain` and `UfoCoin`.

It assumes a local unpruned copy of the blockchain with intact block index, downloaded with [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) 0.15.1+. If you are not sure whether your local copy is valid you can apply `--verify` to validate the chain and block merkle trees. If something doesn't match the parser exits.



## Features

* **Callbacks**

    Callbacks are built on top of the core parser. They can be implemented to extract specific types of information.

    `balances`: dumps all addresses with a non-zero balance.
    The csv file is in the following format:
    ```
    balances.csv
    address ; balance
    ```

    `unspentcsvdump`: dumps all UTXOs along with the address balance.
    The csv file is in the following format:
    ```
    unspent.csv
    txid ; indexOut ; height ; value ; address
    ```
    NOTE: The total size of the csv dump is at least 8 GiB (height 635000).


    `csvdump`: dumps all parsed data as CSV files into the specified `folder`. See [Usage](#Usage) for an example. I chose CSV dumps instead of  an active db-connection because `LOAD DATA INFILE` is the most performant way for bulk inserts.
    The files are in the following format:
    ```
    blocks.csv
    block_hash ; height ; version ; blocksize ; hashPrev ; hashMerkleRoot ; nTime ; nBits ; nNonce
    ```
    ```
    transactions.csv
    txid ; hashBlock ; version ; lockTime
    ```
    ```
    tx_in.csv
    txid ; hashPrevOut ; indexPrevOut ; scriptSig ; sequence
    ```
    ```
    tx_out.csv
    txid ; indexOut ; height ; value ; scriptPubKey ; address
    ```
    If you want to insert the files into MySql see [sql/schema.sql](sql/schema.sql).
    It contains all table structures and SQL statements for bulk inserting. Also see [sql/views.sql](sql/views.sql) for some query examples.
    NOTE: The total size of the csv dump is at least to 731 GiB (height 635000).


    `simplestats`: prints some blockchain statistics like block count, transaction count, avg transactions per block, largest transaction, transaction types etc.

You can also define custom callbacks. A callback gets called at startup, on each block and at the end. See [src/callbacks/mod.rs](src/callbacks/mod.rs) for more information.

* **Low memory usage**

    The required memory usage depends on the used callback:

        * simplestats: ~100MB
        * csvdump: ~100M
        * unspentcsvdump: ~18GB
        * balances: ~18GB

    NOTE: Those values are taken from parsing to block height 639631 (17.07.2020).

* **Script evaluation**

    Evaluates and detects P2PK, [P2PKH](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Pay-to-PubkeyHash), [P2SH](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki) and some non-standard transactions.

* **Resume scans**

    `--start <height>` and `--end <height>` can be passed to resume a scan. However this makes no sense for `unspentcsvdump`!

## Installing

This tool runs on Windows, OS X and Linux.
All you need is `rust` and `cargo`.


### Latest Release

You can download the latest release from crates.io:
```bash
cargo install rusty-blockparser
```

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcarq/rusty-blockparser.git
cd rusty-blockparser
cargo build --release
cargo test --release
./target/release/rusty-blockparser --help
```

It is important to build with `--release`, otherwise you will get a horrible performance!

*Tested on Gentoo Linux with rust-stable 1.44.1

## Customizing the tool for your coin

The tool can easily be customized to your coin. This section outlines the changes that need to be made and is for a beginner user (both with Rust and Blockchain). (This guide is made possible by reviewing the commits made by MerlinMagic2018). During this example the coin name used is NoCoinium.

* The main change is `src/blockchain/parser/types.rs`.
* Add a new entry `pub struct NoCoinium` above the line `//pub struct Dash`(The case you use here is to be carried in all subsequent references, except when noted)
* You will then need to add a `impl Coin for NoCoinium`. You could easily copy a previous block e.g. Bitcoin. The changes you need to do are highlighted below as comments
```
//The name here should be the same case as defined in the pub struct line
impl Coin for NoCoinium {
    fn name(&self) -> String {
        String::from("NoCoinium")
        //This is primarily for display. Use same case as before
    }
    fn magic(&self) -> u32 {
        0xd9b4bef9
        // Magic bytes are a string of hex characters that prefix messages in the chain. 
        // To find this value, look for the fields pchMessageStart[0-3] in the file chainparams.cpp under CMainParams
        // The value to be used here is 0x + pchMessageStart[3] + pchMessageStart[2] + pchMessageStart[1] + pchMessageStart[0]
        // i.e. string the values in reverse.
    }
    fn version_id(&self) -> u8 {
        0x00
        // Version ID is used to identify the address prefix for Base58 encoding of the public address
        // Found this using the stackoverflow comment - https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/62781/litecoin-constants-and-prefixes
        // Again with chainparams.cpp and CMainParams, look for base58Prefixes[PUBKEY_ADDRESS]. Convert the decimal value to Hex and add it here
    }
    fn genesis(&self) -> [u8; 32] {
        utils::hex_to_arr32_swapped(
            "000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f",
            // This is the Genesis Block hash - Get the value from consensus.hashGenesisBlock, again found in chainparams.cpp
        )
    }
    fn default_folder(&self) -> PathBuf {
        Path::new(".nocoinium").join("blocks")
        // This is the folder from the user's home folder to where the blocks files are found
        // Note the case here. It is not CamelCase as most coin directories are lower case. However, use the actual folder name
        // from your coin implementation.
    }
}
```
* Finally, tie these changes within `impl FromStr for CoinType` under `match coin`. The first part will be the case passed as argument to the program (see bullet point below) and the name within `from()` will be the name used above.
```
"nocoinium" => Ok(CoinType::from(NoCoinium)),
```

* The next change is in `src/main.rs`. Under the fn `parse_args()` add your coin to the array of coins. The case you use here will be the same value as you pass in the arguments when executing the blockchain (using the `-c` argument)
* Finally, add your coin name in the README.md file so others know your coin is supported

## TODO

* Implement Pay2MultiSig script evaluation
